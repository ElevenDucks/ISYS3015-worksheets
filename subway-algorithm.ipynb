    "\n",
    "This solution is not obvious or intuitive, and this idea (or another solution)\n",
    "You would build an algorithm by understanding the problem and working through the route-finding process on paper. As you work through a solution, you understand what information you need to track. You then think about what data structure you need to store the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of an alternative solution, you may recognise that the\n",
    "station and lines could be stored as a graph. Then through some \n",
    "research (google searching), you discover Dirjkisk Algorithm. This algorithm is a possible solution and would require you to use a 'graph' data structure and change how we store stations and lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we have gone with the work it out by hand with some\n",
    "hints from the lecturer.\n",

    "> The following class and method are not complete. It provides additional code and methods to add to your existing solution. Read over the code and determine if and where you need to include the code."
